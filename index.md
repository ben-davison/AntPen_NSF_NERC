# NSFGEO-NERC: Investigating the Direct Influence of Meltwater on Antarctic Ice Sheet Dynamics

A temporary site for hosting information about the Antarctic Peninslula project. Initially this will be for use across the team and for storing useful information (pictures, news etc.). Later we could turn this into a more public facing site.

## About the project
This project is jointly funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF). NSF hosts a page about the project [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2053169). 

The current project team (in alphabetical order):
- Isabel Cordero, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, USA
- Jeremy Ely , University of Sheffield, UK
- Nick Frearson, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, USA
- Stephen Livingstone, University of Sheffield, UK
- Jonathan Kingslake, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, USA
- Andrew Sole, University of Sheffield, UK
- Kate Winter, Northumbria University, UK

The are currently advertising for a postdoctoral researcher to work on the project. The advert can be found [here](https://apply.interfolio.com/131480).

The project will fund two field seasons on Flask Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula, and continent wide remote sensing. 

The field plan includes:
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements of ice flow
- Automatic weather station (AWS) measurements of surface melt
- Uncrewed aerial system (UAS) measurements of ice flow
- Ice-penetrating radar measurments of ice flow
- Passive seismic detection of subglacial water flow

The preliminary field plan is shown below.
