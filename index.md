# NSFGEO-NERC: Investigating the Direct Influence of Meltwater on Antarctic Ice Sheet Dynamics

A temporary site for hosting information about the Antarctic Peninslula project. Initially this will be for use across the team and for storing useful information (pictures, news etc.). Later we could turn this into a more public facing site. The github reposoitory behind the site can be found [here](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/AntPen_NSF_NERC/blob/main/index.md). 

## About the project
This project is jointly funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF). NSF hosts a page about the project [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2053169). It is inspired by a paper published by the UK members of the team, ([Tuckett et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12039-2)).

The current project team (in alphabetical order):
- Isabel Cordero, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University, USA
- Ben Davison, University of Sheffield, UK
- Jeremy Ely, University of Sheffield, UK
- Nick Frearson, (LDEO), Columbia University, USA
- Jonathan Kingslake, LDEO, Columbia University, USA
- Stephen Livingstone, University of Sheffield, UK
- Andrew Sole, University of Sheffield, UK
- Rohi Muthyala, LDEO, Columbia University, USA
- Kate Winter, Northumbria University, UK

The project will fund two field seasons on Flask Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula, and continent wide remote sensing. 

The field plan includes:
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements of ice flow
- Automatic weather station (AWS) measurements of surface melt
- Measurements of near surface temperatures with a thermister string
- Uncrewed aerial system (UAS) measurements of ice flow
- Ice-penetrating radar measurements of ice flow
- Passive seismic detection of subglacial water flow

The preliminary field plan is shown below.

### Jun 13th 2024
Rohi is in Juneau, AK, testing out one of the Wingtra UAS. Everything is going well and she has sent back some incredible footage:

### Jun 11th 2024
Our first major shipment has successfully left Lamont! Nine individual items were palletized and shipped out this afternoon! This includes one of the Wingtra UAS, the ApRES units, a kovacs ice drill, laptops, tools. The shipment is due to arrive in Port Hueneme on Friday where it will continue its journey by ship to Punta Arenas, Chile.


### May-June 2024
#### Purchasing and packing!
Led my Rohi and Isabel, we have been frantically scoping equipment, getting quotes, signing up vendors to the Columbia system, purchasing euipment and eagerly unwrapping all science toys as they arrive. We've ordered all the components of the automatic weather station (including thermistor strings and an appropriately pre-programmed logger and customized logger enclosure), tools, zarge boxes, drills, pelican cases, laptops, SD cards, hard drives, stationary, chargers, batteries, and more. Thanks to Knut Christianson at The university of Washington, we also received four ApRES units back from Antarctica. Shipping delays meant that they arrived at LDEO roughly a week before they needed to be shipped south again, but we had time to test them and trouble shoot some issues. 

This photo does a pretty good job of showing the chaos that happens when your trying to unpack, test, and repack several differnt instruments in a small space

We also purchased a new weather proof case for the Wingtra UAV:

### May 2024
We are very excited to welcome Ben Davison to the project as a postdoctoral researcher based at the University of Sheffield. Ben did his PhD at Sheffield and did a PhD at Leeds before coming back to the Sheffield for this project. Ben will take part in the first Antarctic field season in Nov-Dec 2024. This completes the science side of field team: Rohi, Ben and Kate Winter. They will be joined by a BAS field assistant on Flask Glacier. 

### Apr 1st 2024
We are very excited to welcome Dr Rohi Muthyala to the project as a postdoctoral researcher based at LDEO. Rohi did her PhD at Rutgers and has many years experience working on and around the Greenland Ice Sheet. Rohi will take part in the first Antarctic field season in Nov-Dec 2024. We are so pleased to have her on board!

### Jan 24th 2024

The UAS arrived and Jonny went through unpacking everything and checking what's there. Looks like almost everything is present and correct! Next steps are to register it, assemble it, and start testing for (hopefully) a testing season in Alaska this summer.

### Jan 23rd 2024
The UAS has arrived! Yesterday we received the WingtraOne uncrewed aerial system. More photos to follow.

### Dec 15, 2023
We advertised a Sheffiled-based postdoctoral research associate to work on the project. Details about the job and how to apply can be found [here](https://shorturl.at/lmuD3). Apologies for the incorrect closing date and typos at this link; the closing date is Monday 5th February and we anticipate interviewing for the post later in February.

### Sep 21, 2023
We had Tom from Wingtra at LDEO today demonstrating their UAS.

### Sep 19, 2023 
Excited to hear that we will be getting a demo from a company called Wingtra of their vertical take off, fixed-wing uncrewed aerial system (UAS) tomorrow on the Lamont campus. 

### Sep 06, 2023
